# zoro-list-to-mal

## wip: i have no idea what i'm doing yet again but i wanted to help a friend

## things to fix:
- ~~make it use `.json` files as input bc zoro.to gives more info with that (like watch status)~~
- ~~i forgor :skull:~~
- fix the xml import(?)

## features:
- bad code
- ~~set all of your list as "Completed"~~ fixed. instead, you get to have all your ep progress set to 0 bc zoro doesnt give that info on the json
